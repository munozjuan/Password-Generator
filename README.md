## Description  

 
Dealing with sensitive data, as an employee, I was tasked to make a password generator that would randomly generate a random password. Using certain criteria I wanted to make passwords for users that provide greater security. I want to ask the user to first choose the length of their password; in this case it will be a number between 8-128. I will use a button that will prompt the user to answer these questions. The next question is going to be if they want to use uppercase letter and if they choose no they will only get lower case. I will ask if they want numbers or special characters. If they choose no to all of those they will only receive lower case passwords. Then they will see their secure password generated.
